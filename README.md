A simulation of the Monty Hall Problem.

The paradox stems from the gameshow Let's Make a Deal and its host Monty Hall.

"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

This program simulates a player playing the game, and switches his initial choice every time, then prints statistics at the end to prove that it is beneficial to switch your answer every time
